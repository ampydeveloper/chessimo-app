            <div id="tipp-1" class="tipp odd"><h1>1. Rapidly develop all pieces</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-001.gif" alt="Tipp 1" /><p>The main goal at opening is to develop pieces and reach castling as quick as possible.</p>
              <p>Opening is complete when one or both players have their Rooks connected.</p>
              <p>The player, who finishes the development first, gains the initiative. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-2" class="tipp even"><h1>2. Develop Knights before Bishops</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-002.gif" alt="Tipp 2" /><p>While Bishops can control several squares from their original position, if there are no pawns obstructing their way, Knights dominate only their neighbour squares and take longer to reach the opponent&rsquo;s field, because they are less mobile pieces.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-3" class="tipp odd"><h1>3. Don’t move the same piece twice during opening</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-003.gif" alt="Tipp 3" /><p>Try to place your pieces at the best possible position at the first move.</p>
              <p>It is a waste of time to move the same piece more than once during opening and it may cost you the initiative in the game. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-4" class="tipp even"><h1>4. Don’t make unnecessary pawns moves during opening</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-004.gif" alt="Tipp 4" /><p>Pawn moves should be restricted during opening, because the time involved in these moves could be applied to develop another piece.</p>
              <p>Generally, moving pawns is suitable when the player aims to open diagonals for the Queen or Bishops or occupy the center. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-5" class="tipp odd"><h1>5. Don’t check if not necessary</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-005.gif" alt="Tipp 5" /><p>A check that can easily be defended by the opponent is unnecessary.</p>
              <p>Most of the checks during opening can easily be defended by moves that favor development. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-6" class="tipp even"><h1>6. Don’t open a position if you are late in development</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-006.gif" alt="Tipp 6" /><p>An open position favors the color with more pieces in the game.</p>
              <p>Therefore, only the player who has an advantage in development should produce an open position.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-7" class="tipp odd"><h1>7. Place the Queen behind the line of friendly pawns during opening</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-007.gif" alt="Tipp 7" /><p>Since the Queen is a very powerful piece, it is also very vulnerable to the opponent&rsquo;s constant attacks.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s convenient to place it behind a pawn, preferably on the second rank so that the first one is free for Rook development.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-8" class="tipp even"><h1>8. Avoid trading a developed piece for a not developed one</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-008.gif" alt="Tipp 8" /><p>Generally, it&rsquo;s a bad deal to trade a well-positioned piece for a bad-positioned one.</p>
              <p>When you trade one of your developed pieces for one of your opponent&rsquo;s not developed ones, you waste time.</p>
              <p>The same is true if you trade a piece that has moved a lot for one that your opponent moved only once.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-9" class="tipp odd"><h1>9. Castle as quickly as possible</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-009.gif" alt="Tipp 9" /><p>The King&rsquo;s safety &eacute; is one of the most important things to care about during opening and middlegame.</p>
              <p>The King in the center will always be very vulnerable to the opponent&rsquo;s attacks, especially in open positions.</p>
              <p>Castling means placing your King comfortably behind a pawn blockade and allowing development of one of your Rooks.<br />
                Then, the Rook may rapidly occupy an open or half-open file. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-10" class="tipp even"><h1>10. Kingside castling is safer than Queenside castling</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-010.gif" alt="Tipp 10" /><p>Kingside castling places the King away from the center and safer behind a rank of protected pawns; furthermore it&rsquo;s a quicker move than Queenside castling since only 2 pieces have to be moved before.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, castling on the opponent&rsquo;s opposite side may be very interesting to create more attacking opportunities.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-11" class="tipp odd"><h1>11. Try to prevent the opponent from castling</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-011.gif" alt="Tipp 11" /><p>If your opponent is waiting too long to castle, try to keep the enemy King even longer in the center.</p>
              <p>One of the most common ways to do so is to control one of the squares serving as passage for the King (usually f1 or f8, when Kingside castling).</p>
              <p>Most of the times it&rsquo;s worthwhile to sacrifice a pawn in order to keep the King in the center. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-12" class="tipp even"><h1>12. Dominate as much territory as possible</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-012.gif" alt="Tipp 12" /><p>The player, who has an advantage in space, enables greater mobility to friendly pieces and can, therefore, transfer pieces from one side to the other with more flexibility.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the player in a more restricted position finds it difficult to maneuver pieces, which might be fatal if they are requested to defend the King.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-13" class="tipp odd"><h1>13. Advance pawns in order to conquer space</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-013.gif" alt="Tipp 13" /><p>Although advancing pawns is the main resource to restrict the opponent&rsquo;s position, this rule should be considered carefully because the farer the pawns are from base position the harder it is to defend them.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, each position advanced by a pawn creates weakness at its adjacent squares, which may be occupied by enemy pieces.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-14" class="tipp even"><h1>14. As pawns advance they get more difficult to protect</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-014.gif" alt="Tipp 14" /><p>A weak pawn is one that is not defended by another pawn, which means, that it must be defended by pieces, when it is under attack.</p>
              <p>Those pieces lose much of their effectiveness because they have to assume a defensive role, while enemy pieces get an active role.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-15" class="tipp odd"><h1>15. Place your pawns in the center</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-015.gif" alt="Tipp 15" /><p>The center of the chessboard consists of e4, e5, d4 and d5. The expanded center also includes the squares that form the c3, c6, f3 and f6 rectangle.</p>
              <p>Pawns are the best units to create the center because, differently from pieces, they are not vulnerable to the attack of enemy pawns.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-16" class="tipp even"><h1>16. Keep your pieces as close as possible to the center</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-016.gif" alt="Tipp 16" /><p>In the center, a piece controls more squares than anywhere else on the board. The Knight, for instance, may move to 8 different squares from the center while it has only 2 options when placed in corners.</p>
              <p>The control of the center is also important because it enables pieces to move rapidly from one side of the board to the other, and if your pieces move faster than the ones of your opponent, you have greater chances to create a successful attack.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-17" class="tipp odd"><h1>17. When trading pawns, try to get yours as close as possible to the center</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-017.gif" alt="Tipp 17" /><p>If two of your pawns can retake the opponent&rsquo;s piece that previously captured one of your pieces, it is recommended to move the pawn that, at the end, will be closest to the center, since central pawns are more important than lateral ones.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-18" class="tipp even"><h1>18. Control the center before attacking</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-018.gif" alt="Tipp 18" /><p>Successful attacks on the wings depend mostly on center control.</p>
              <p>Therefore, concern yourself with a strong and stable center before starting any lateral attack.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-19" class="tipp odd"><h1>19. Pawns are the foundation of strategy</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-019.gif" alt="Tipp 19" /><p>The pawn structure is fundamental to any position, because it improves or reduces the effectiveness of pieces.</p>
              <p>In order to achieve good pawn conformation, all different kinds of weak pawns should be avoided: isolated, doubled, backward and hanging pawns.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-20" class="tipp even"><h1>20. Pawn weakness is eternal</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-020.gif" alt="Tipp 20" /><p>While pieces can move to become more active, any deficiency in pawn structure is a long-term weakness.</p>
              <p>Therefore, if your opponent has weak pawns, you don&rsquo;t need to hurry to explore them.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-21" class="tipp odd"><h1>21. Avoid doubled pawns</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-021.gif" alt="Tipp 21" /><p>Doubled pawns are two pawns of the same color lined up on the same file.</p>
              <p>They have less mobility than normal ones and are more vulnerable to attacks, especially when isolated.</p>
              <p>However, they do not always represent a disadvantage.</p>
              <p>Dominance of an open or a half-open adjacent file, or even additional control of the center, may often be a sufficient compensation.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-22" class="tipp even"><h1>22. Avoid isolated pawns</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-022.gif" alt="Tipp 22" /><p>Isolated pawns are those with no friendly pawn on either adjacent file. Therefore, they cannot be defended by a pawn of the same color, when they are under attack and have to be protected by a piece.</p>
              <p>The main weakness of an isolated pawn is that the square directly in front of it is debilitated (a hole), because it cannot be controlled by another pawn and is easily occupied by an enemy piece.</p>
              <p>Isolated pawns are even more vulnerable when placed in half-open files, because they become easy targets for enemy Rooks.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-23" class="tipp odd"><h1>23. Avoid backward pawns</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-023.gif" alt="Tipp 23" /><p>A backward pawn is closer to its base considering its adjacent comrades and is prevented from advancing, because the square directly in front of it is under an enemy pawn&rsquo;s control.</p>
              <p>A backward pawn usually impairs communication between defensive pieces and the weak square (hole) in front of it may easily be occupied by an enemy piece.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-24" class="tipp even"><h1>24. Avoid creating holes (weak squares)</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-024.gif" alt="Tipp 24" /><p>Every time you advance a pawn, the squares beside him become holes.</p>
              <p>A hole is a square that cannot be protected by pawns.</p>
              <p>Its main disadvantage is that it is easily occupied by enemy pieces, improving their effectiveness, because they are not easily chased away from their positions, since they are free from opponent pawn attacks.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-25" class="tipp odd"><h1>25. Avoid pawn islands</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-025.gif" alt="Tipp 25" /><p>A pawn group separated from the others by one or more files is called an island.</p>
              <p>Each island contains a basic position that has to be protected by other pieces.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the more islands a player possesses the harder it gets to defend them. It is useful to consider influences on the pawn structure every time you trade pieces.</p>
              <p>At the endgame, the smallest number of islands may be considered a significant advantage.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-26" class="tipp even"><h1>26. Think carefully before advancing hanging pawns</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-026.gif" alt="Tipp 26" /><p>Hanging pawns are two friendly neighbour pawns that have no comrades on adjacent squares.</p>
              <p>If they are placed in the same rank, they can control many squares in front of them, which is an advantage. But, on the other hand, they cannot be defended by other pawns.</p>
              <p>Advancing one of them results in creating a backward pawn and a hole, both to be explored by the opponent.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-27" class="tipp odd"><h1>27. Put pressure on the opponent’s backward pawn</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-027.gif" alt="Tipp 27" /><p>Usually, the best way to explore a backward pawn is to put pressure on it, so that the enemy uses resources in its defense, and afterwards, attack at another point of the board.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-28" class="tipp even"><h1>28. Force your opponent to advance hanging pawns</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-028.gif" alt="Tipp 28" /><p>In order to fight hanging pawns, you have to put them under pressure until a pawn advances, which results in a hole that you can occupy.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-29" class="tipp odd"><h1>29. Whenever possible, create a passed pawn</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-029.gif" alt="Tipp 29" /><p>Passed pawn is the one that doesn&rsquo;t have enemy pawns in its way in its file or in adjacent files.</p>
              <p>A passed pawn is considered a very dangerous weapon, because it may reach the final rank and be promoted.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-30" class="tipp even"><h1>30. Always blockade your opponent’s passed pawns</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-030.gif" alt="Tipp 30" /><p>A passed pawn can become a very powerful weapon, especially when it is well protected by enemy pieces; therefore it has to be immobilized as fast as possible.</p>
              <p>To block a pawn is to prevent it from advancing by placing a piece in its way.</p>
              <p>Knights and Bishops are considered the best pieces for blockades.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-31" class="tipp odd"><h1>31. The Knight is the best piece to block a passed pawn</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-031.gif" alt="Tipp 31" /><p>Thanks to its ability to jump over all units, the Knight is considered the best piece to block a passed pawn, because its range isn&rsquo;t impaired by the pawn itself.</p>
              <p>The Bishop is the second best blockader, especially if the pawn&rsquo;s adjacent diagonals are open.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-32" class="tipp even"><h1>32. Pawn majority distant from the enemy King is an advantage</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-032.gif" alt="Tipp 32" /><p>Majority is when a player possesses more pawns on one side than the opponent. For example, 2 against 1, 3 against 2, etc...</p>
              <p>In many cases, majority results in a spatial advantage, but most important is that this majority always produces a passed pawn, when pawns are correctly advanced.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-33" class="tipp odd"><h1>33. Minority attack</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-033.gif" alt="Tipp 33" /><p>Whenever a color has majority of pawns on one side, the other color may perform a minority attack.</p>
              <p>This attack consists of advancing pawns in order to force trades, leaving the opponent with only one isolated pawn or a backward one.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-34" class="tipp even"><h1>34. Avoid unnecessary trades</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-034.gif" alt="Tipp 34" /><p>As a general rule, you should only trade pieces:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When your opponent has the initiative</li>
                <li>
                  When you are in a restricted position</li>
                <li>
                  In order to weaken your opponent&rsquo;s pawn structure</li>
                <li>
                  When you are in material advantage</li>
                <li>
                  In order to trade off a passive piece for an active one of your opponent</li>
                <li>
                  In order to simplify position and reach a more favorable endgame</li>
                <li>
                  In order to eliminate an important enemy defense</li>
              </ul>
              </div><div id="tipp-35" class="tipp odd"><h1>35. The value of a piece varies according to its position</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-035.gif" alt="Tipp 35" /><p>The value of a piece is, generally, consistent with the number of squares it dominates, because the more squares it controls, the more it threatens the opponent.</p>
              <p>A well-positioned piece is of much higher value than the equivalent enemy piece that occupies a bad position.</p>
              <p>In general, a well-positioned piece has the following qualities: it is protected, has great mobility, isn&rsquo;t easily attacked, cooperates with the other pieces and attacks enemy pieces or pawns.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-36" class="tipp even"><h1>36. Whenever possible, place your Rooks on the 7th or 8th rank</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-036.gif" alt="Tipp 36" /><p>A Rook on the 7th rank is an advantage, not only because it represents danger to enemy pawns, but also because it restricts the opponent&rsquo;s King and creates various mate possibilities.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-37" class="tipp odd"><h1>37. Double Rooks on the 7th rank</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-037.gif" alt="Tipp 37" /><p>Two Rooks occupying the 7th rank is an extremely dangerous weapon, because the enemy is condemned to the most complete passivity.</p>
              <p>The enormous amount of pressure on the pawn base and the possibility of innumerous tactic themes, almost always turn this advantage into a win.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-38" class="tipp even"><h1>38. Not always a pawn should be promoted into a Queen</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-038.gif" alt="Tipp 38" /><p>In amateur games, automatically queening a pawn has been the reason for many stalemate draws.</p>
              <p>Carefully consider which piece is most appropriate for that specific circumstance.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-39" class="tipp odd"><h1>39. Keep your Knights close to the center</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-039.gif" alt="Tipp 39" /><p>Knights, more than any other piece, need to be close to the center of the chessboard.</p>
              <p>First, because a Knight can control 8 squares from the center, while from the borders it controls only 4.</p>
              <p>Second, because a Knight needs 4 moves to cross the chessboard and reach the other side, while from the center it takes only 2 to get to one of the borders.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-40" class="tipp even"><h1>40. Rooks should rapidly occupy open or half-open files</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-040.gif" alt="Tipp 40" /><p>During opening, Rooks are the last pieces to be developed, because they are effective when they settle on open or half-open files.</p>
              <p>Usually, the ideal squares to place Rooks are e1, d1 and c1 (e8, d8 and c8 for Black), because from these positions they can put pressure on the center and defend the backrank at the same time.</p>
              <p>A Rook may, however, be an effective defense when placed on the 2nd file, while it still operates aggressively in the file.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-41" class="tipp odd"><h1>41.  Keep your Bishops active</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-041.gif" alt="Tipp 41" /><p>The activity of a Bishop depends mostly of his friendly pawns&rsquo; placement.</p>
              <p>A Bishop that is not blocked by its own pawns is a good Bishop and the one that is limited by its pawns is a bad Bishop.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-42" class="tipp even"><h1>42.  Keep your pawns on squares of the same color of your opponent’s Bishop</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-042.gif" alt="Tipp 42" /><p>When your opponent has only one Bishop, you should place your pawns on squares of the corresponding color of the square occupied by the enemy Bishop.</p>
              <p>However, if you have only one Bishop, then the color of your pawns&rsquo; squares should not correspond to your Bishops placement, whether your opponent has only one Bishop or not.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-43" class="tipp odd"><h1>43.  A Bishop is worth more than a Knight on open positions</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-043.gif" alt="Tipp 43" /><p>Bishops must have diagonals to operate in order to be more effective, therefore the less there are pawns on the chessboard, the more effective they get.</p>
              <p>In open positions - when diagonals aren&rsquo;t obstructed by pawns - a Bishop can attack the kingside and protect its own flank from the Queen, at the same time.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, a Knight can maneuver only on one side due to its restricted mobility.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-44" class="tipp even"><h1>44. A Knight is worth more than a Bishop in closed positions</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-044.gif" alt="Tipp 44" /><p>Due to their ability to jump over other units, Knights perform better than Bishops in rigid pawn chain positions.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-45" class="tipp odd"><h1>45. Knights need outposts</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-045.gif" alt="Tipp 45" /><p>An outpost is a square, usually in the 5th and 6th ranks, that is under the protection of a pawn and isn&rsquo;t subject to enemy pawn attacks.</p>
              <p>When a Knight occupies an outpost, it puts a great deal of pressure on the opponent&rsquo;s camp and it also supports the development of flank attacks.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-46" class="tipp even"><h1>46. Usually, in mobile pawn endgames, the Bishop is worth more than a Knight</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-046.gif" alt="Tipp 46" /><p>In the Bishop&rsquo;s fight against the Knight, the Bishop&rsquo;s color should try to keep its pawns mobile, while the other camp should paralyze these enemy pawns, preferably on squares of the same color as the square occupied by their Bishop.</p>
              </div><div id="tipp-47" class="tipp odd"><h1>47. Two Bishops are, usually, stronger than Bishop and Knight and than two Knights</h1><img src="../../assets/tips/images/T-047.gif" alt="Tipp 47" /><p>The Bishop is a long-range piece and its main disadvantage is the ability to control only squares of the same color.</p>
              <p>Therefore, two Bishops complement each other perfectly. When well coordinated, they are superior to a Bishop and a Knight, because these enemies take too long to reach the active field due to the limited mobility of the Knight.</p>

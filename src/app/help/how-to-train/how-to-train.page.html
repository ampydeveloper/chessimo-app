              <p style="margin-top: 0;">Chessimo&acute;s &reg; innovative approach to chess training is based on repeatedly solving real game situations chosen by the Brazilian GM Gilberto Milos. The exercises are sorted by themes (tactics, strategy, endgames) and severity.</p>
              <p>The themes are grouped by modules, each module is split into several units and each unit consists of up to 720 exercises.</p>
              <p>Chessimo &reg; helps you to improve your basic knowledge in tactics, endgames, openings and strategy in a playful way. Each exercise demonstrates the interactive training and asks you for the correct answer to a question posed by the software.</p>
              <p>Chessimo &reg; helps you,</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To significantly improve your ability to combine moves</li>
                <li>
                  To recognize tactical moves quicker</li>
                <li>
                  To perfect your openings and endgames</li>
                <li>
                  To think ahead more efficiently</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The first goal is achieved once you&rsquo;ve completed each exercise once. This will be marked by a blue point marking the unit in the overview.</p>
              <p>Clicking the &ldquo;Exercises x/y&rdquo; button will show you which exercises of this module you&rsquo;ve already solved, and how often.</p>
              <p>Ideally you will want to play through all units of one module, then progress to the next module and its exercises.</p>
              <p>The first screen in the train menu displays your progress in relation to the end date determined in the settings.</p>
              <p>If you are behind the target the progress bar will appear in red. If you are in line the progress bar will be green. If you have completed a section it will be displayed in blue.</p>
              <p>The &bdquo;History&ldquo; Button will give you a full overview of all exercises already performed.</p>
              <p>Please touch the Train button to start your training.</p>
              <p>Chose one of the five themes and start or continue your training.</p>
              <p>Chessimo &reg; displays a game situation for each exercise and asks for a solution, i.e. &bdquo;What is white&acute;s best move&ldquo;</p>
              <p>To answer the question, move the correct piece to the correct destination. A blue check mark will indicate a correct solution and you may progress to the next exercise (by clicking the arrow bottom right).</p>
              <p>If you don&acute;t get it right immediately Chessimo &reg; will highlight the correct piece in yellow . After two more failed attempts Chessimo &reg; will also highlight the correct target square &ndash; in green.</p>
              <p>&bdquo;Show moves&ldquo; displays an overview of all moves.</p>
              <p>In the upper right corner you will find information about your current exercise (no x out of a total y in this module). Click this button to see how often you have performed the exercises of this module already.</p>
              <p>Click the navigation buttons to repeat your exercise or move to the next/previous one.</p>
              <p>If the exercises of a unit have been performed six times the exercise will be marked blue.</p>
